*Artificial intelligence* is the science of creating systems to perform tasks that would normally require human intelligence.
# Acting Rationally
**This definition of AI is the focus of this class.**

A [[Rational Agents | rational agent]] selects actions that maximizes its (expected) utility. To choose rational actions, the [[Agent Overview | agent]] must utilize characteristics of precepts, environment analysis, and action space to dictate the techniques. This is not always feasible in complicated [[Environment Overview| environments]] with high computational demands and limited rationality.
# Acting Like a Human
One definition of AI that seeks to make machines "intelligent." This **requires** the computer to have the following capabilities: natural language processing (NLP), knowledge representation to store what it knows/hears, automated reasoning to use stored information to draw answers, and machines learning to adapt to new circumstances and detect patterns.
## Turing Test
The Turing Test involves a human interrogator posing written questions to a person or computer. The test is passed if the interrogator is unable to ascertain if the subject is a person or a computer.
### Total Turing Test
This is a super-set of the Turing Test that removes the written constraints to include a video signal to test the computers perceptual abilities. This expands the computer's required capabilities to include computer vision to perceive objects and robotics to interact with said objects. 
## Searle's Chinese Room Argument
This argument imagines a machines locked in a room with an input of Chinese characters. The machine has an instruction program and outputs Chinese characters. This machines would pass the [[#Turing Test | Turing Test]]; however, does it *know* Chinese? Searle argues that it is **impossible** to prove a computer has some form of "mind" or "consciousness."
# Thinking Like a Human
Definition of AI that requires cognitive science to determine how a human "thinks" and traces this thought process to a machine. This method focuses less on the final output of the machine, but on the steps that it takes to reach said output. Cognitive sciences are required for this take and requires introspection, psychological experiments, and brain imaging to further understand the human brain.
# Thinking Rationally
This definition seeks to apply the "laws of thought" to AI. AI should be purely logical and follow the correct inferences. This method is particularly difficult if all the domain knowledge cannot be represented by formal logic, if there exists too many variables to take into account, and if there exists some uncertainty in the input.
