# Tree
Data structure with a hierarchical structure containing a collection of **nodes** connected by edges. Each node may have zero or more child nodes also connected by edges, but must have only one parent node. The only node except from this rule is the *root node*, which does not have a parent node and sits at the top of the tree.
# Graph
Data structure with composed of vertices (**nodes**) and edges that connect the nodes. Graphs are able to be directed or undirected based on the situation and implementation.

Unlike [[Basic Data Structures#Tree| trees]], graphs do not contain a singular root node.
# Queue
Data structure with a *first-in, first-out* structure. New additions will be added the back of the queue and all removals will removed from the top.
# Priority Queue
This is a special kind of [[#Queue | queue]] that will sort the queue based on a specific element. Higher-priority elements will be given preferential treatment, placing them at the top of the queue.
# Stack
Data structure with a *last-in, first-out* structure. New additions will be added to the top and all removals will be removed from the top.
